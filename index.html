			<p>Matthew Jaskiewicz is a renowned music director in Europe and in North America. He received his conducting training at the Warsaw Academy of Music in Poland, and after graduating, he soon established his reputation as a outstanding director with the Warsaw University Choir. The choir’s greatest achievement was winning first prize at the British Middlesborough Choral Competition in 1970. In the 1971-72 season, Matthew directed the award- winning men and boys’ choir, Les Rossignolet de Roubaix, in France.  After returning to Poland, Matthew became the conductor of the Warsaw Chamber Opera, where he created the Ars Antiqua Chamber Choir. When the choir moved to the Warsaw Music Society, Matthew became the music director of the series of concerts at various churches in Warsaw.</p>
			<p>Soon after arriving in Canada in 1984, Mr. Jaskiewicz founded the Polish Canadian Society of Music and the Musica Antiqua Chamber Choir and Orchestra (now the Toronto Sinfonietta), and co-founded the Oakham House Choir at Ryerson University. Since then he has been instrumental in establishing both the choir and the Sinfonietta as respected performers on Toronto’s musical scene. Mr. Jaskiewicz is also well regarded for his work with the Northumberland Orchestra and Choir in Cobourg, Ontario, which he directed for 17 years, and for his work with the Baycrest Music Society.  He has also directed the Polish Symfonia Choir in Hamilton and the Angel Choir, for children, in Toronto’s Chinese community.</p>
